# E-commerce_SQL_data_analysis-of-Zepto

This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

#🔧 Project Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what I have done in this project:

1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
2. Data Import
Loaded CSV using pgAdmin's import feature.

If you're not able to use the import feature, write this code instead:

   \copy zepto(category,name,mrp,discountPercent,availableQuantity,
            discountedSellingPrice,weightInGms,outOfStock,quantity)
  FROM 'data/zepto_v2.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', QUOTE '"', ENCODING 'UTF8');
Faced encoding issues (UTF-8 error), which were fixed by saving the CSV file using CSV UTF-8 format.
3. 🔍 Data Exploration
Counted the total number of records in the dataset

Viewed a sample of the dataset to understand structure and content

Checked for null values across all columns

Identified distinct product categories available in the dataset

Compared in-stock vs out-of-stock product counts

Detected products present multiple times, representing different SKUs

4. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Identified and removed rows where MRP or discounted selling price was zero

Converted mrp and discountedSellingPrice from paise to rupees for consistency and readability

5. 📊 Business Insights
Found top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage

Identified high-MRP products that are currently out of stock

Estimated potential revenue for each product category

Filtered expensive products (MRP > ₹500) with minimal discount

Ranked top 5 categories offering highest average discounts

Calculated price per gram to identify value-for-money products

Grouped products based on weight into Low, Medium, and Bulk categories

Measured total inventory weight per product category
